This repository demonstrates a race condition issue with Firebase transactions. The issue occurs due to inconsistent data when multiple clients concurrently update the same document.  The 'bug.js' file shows the problematic code, while 'bugSolution.js' offers a solution using optimistic concurrency control.  The primary challenge lies in handling multiple concurrent updates efficiently while maintaining data consistency.
